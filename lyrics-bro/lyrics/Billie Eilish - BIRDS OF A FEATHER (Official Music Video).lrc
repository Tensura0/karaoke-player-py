[00:00.31] (Without you, my baby)
[00:03.68] I want you to stay
[00:08.22] 'Til I'm in the grave
[00:12.73] 'Til I rot away, dead and buried
[00:17.35] 'Til I'm in the casket you carry
[00:21.55] If you go, I'm going too, uh
[00:26.52] 'Cause it was always you (alright)
[00:30.86] And if I'm turning blue, please don't save me
[00:35.68] Nothing left to lose without my baby
[00:41.63] Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know
[00:46.27] I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone
[00:50.95] Can't change the weather, might not be forever
[00:54.70] But if it's forever, it's even better
[00:59.93] And I don't know what I'm crying for
[01:04.96] I don't think I could love you more
[01:09.17] It might not be long, but baby, I
[01:15.45] I'll love you 'til the day that I die
[01:20.77] 'Til the day that I die
[01:25.41] 'Til the light leaves my eyes
[01:30.08] 'Til the day that I die
[01:35.03] I want you to see, hm
[01:39.70] How you look to me, hm
[01:44.28] You wouldn't believe if I told ya
[01:48.75] You would keep the compliments I throw ya
[01:53.22] But you're so full of shit, uh
[01:57.91] Tell me it's a bit, oh
[02:02.55] Say you don't see it, your mind's polluted
[02:07.01] Say you wanna quit, don't be stupid
[02:12.98] And I don't know what I'm crying for
[02:18.02] I don't think I could love you more
[02:22.26] Might not be long, but baby, I
[02:26.77] 
[02:29.19] Don't wanna say goodbye
[02:31.40] Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know ('til the day that I die)
[02:35.98] I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone ('til the light leaves my eyes)
[02:40.40] Can't change the weather, might not be forever ('til the day that I die)
[02:44.34] But if it's forever, it's even better
[02:49.81] I knew you in another life
[02:54.52] You had that same look in your eyes
[02:59.58] I love you, don't act so surprised
[03:02.69]
